## **📖 Introduction**

This project provides a comprehensive guide to deploying a 🌐 Vue.js frontend and 🔧 Java-based microservices backend on AWS using best practices for DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The solution includes CI/CD pipelines for automation and monitoring for performance and security.

---

## **🔧 Prerequisites**

1. **🛠 Technical Knowledge**:

   - Familiarity with Vue.js, Java Spring Boot, Docker, Terraform, and AWS.

2. **⚙️ Required Tools**:

   - Terraform and AWS CLI installed and configured.

   - Docker installed locally for image creation.

   - GitHub repository access for source code management.

3. **🌐 AWS Resources**:

   - IAM roles with permissions for ECS, S3, and CodePipeline.

   - Pre-created S3 bucket for frontend hosting.

   - ECR repository for Docker images.

---

## **🚀 Steps for Deployment**

### **🖼️ Step 1: Setup Frontend**

1. **📂 Prepare the Vue Application**:

   - Clone the Vue.js repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-vue.git
     cd frontend-vue

     ```

   - Build the application:

     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run build

     ```

2. **🗂️ Deploy to S3**:

   - Sync the `dist/` folder to the S3 bucket:

     ```bash
     aws s3 sync dist/ s3://frontend-vue-app --acl public-read

     ```

3. **✅ Verify Deployment**:

   - Access the application via the S3 bucket's public URL.

### **🔧 Step 2: Setup Backend Microservices**

1. **📂 Prepare Microservices**:

   - Clone and build each microservice:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-org/service-a.git
     cd service-a
     mvn clean package

     ```

2. **🐳 Dockerize and Push to ECR**:

   - Build and tag the Docker image:

     ```bash
     docker build -t service-a .
     docker tag service-a:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/service-a:latest
     docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/service-a:latest

     ```

3. **🚢 Deploy to ECS**:

   - Use Terraform to define and deploy tasks and services for each microservice.

---

### **🌐 Step 3: Configure Infrastructure with Terraform**

1. **📦 Initialize Terraform**:

   - Navigate to the Terraform directory and initialize:

     ```bash
     cd devops-infra/terraform
     terraform init

     ```

2. **🚀 Apply the Configuration**:

   - Deploy the resources:

     ```bash
     terraform plan
     terraform apply

     ```

---

### **🔄 Step 4: CI/CD Pipelines**

1. **🌈 Frontend Pipeline**:

   - Configure GitHub Actions to automate builds and S3 deployment. Example:

     ```yaml
     name: Deploy Frontend
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     jobs:
       build_and_deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: 16
           - run: npm install
           - run: npm run build
           - uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.1
             with:
               args: --acl public-read

     ```

2. **🐳 Backend Pipeline**:

   - Set up GitHub Actions for building Docker images and deploying to ECS.

---

## **🛡️ Monitoring and Security**

1. **📊 CloudWatch Metrics**:

   - Enable ECS metrics and create alarms for high CPU or memory usage.

2. **🔒 Security Best Practices**:

   - Use IAM roles for ECS tasks.

   - Encrypt sensitive data with AWS Secrets Manager.

---

## **🌟 Benefits of the Setup**

- **⚡ Scalable Infrastructure**: Easily handle traffic spikes with ECS and S3.

- **🤖 Automated Pipelines**: Streamlined development lifecycle with GitHub Actions.

- **🔍 Comprehensive Monitoring**: CloudWatch for real-time insights.

---

## **📌 Conclusion**

This deployment guide provides a robust solution for managing frontend and backend applications on AWS, leveraging Terraform and CI/CD pipelines to ensure efficiency, scalability, and security.

## üìä Diagram

![Architecture Diagram][diagram]

- This diagram visualizes how the **microservices architecture** is deployed on **AWS** with components such as **S3**, **ECS**, **RDS**, **ECR**, **CloudWatch**, and **SNS**.

- The **Frontend** is hosted in **S3** and accessed via HTTP. The **Backend** consists of multiple microservices (deployed on **ECS**) that interact with **RDS** for database storage and **SQS** for message queuing.

- **GitHub Actions** automates the CI/CD pipeline for both **frontend** and **backend** applications. The pipeline includes security testing, builds Docker images, and deploys them to **ECR** before deploying the services to **ECS**.

- **CloudWatch** and **SNS** are used for **monitoring** and **alerting** the system's health and deployment status.

### Components

1. **Frontend (CI/CD triggers from GitHub Actions)**:
   The Vue.js application deployed to **S3**, triggered by GitHub Actions pipeline.

2. **Backend (Microservices in ECS)**:
   - Microservices are containerized using **Docker** and deployed to **Amazon ECS**.
   - **ECR** is used to store Docker images.

3. **AWS Services**:
   - **S3** for static asset storage (frontend).
   - **ECS** for managing microservice containers.
   - **RDS** for database management.
   - **CloudWatch** for logs and metrics.
   - **SNS** for notifications and alerts.
   - **SQS** for message queuing between microservices.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - **GitHub Actions** automates the pipeline for building, testing, and deploying both frontend and backend.

---

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and AWS Integration

### 1. **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**

GitHub Actions is used to automate the build, test, and deployment process for both frontend and backend services.

- **Frontend Deployment to S3**:
  - GitHub Actions builds the Vue.js frontend application and uploads it to an **S3 bucket**.

- **Backend Microservices Deployment to ECS**:
  - For each microservice, GitHub Actions builds Docker images and pushes them to **ECR**.
  - The images are then deployed to **ECS** as part of the microservices' architecture.

### 2. **Sample GitHub Actions Workflow for Backend Microservices**

```yaml
name: Backend CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Docker image for service
        run: docker build -t my-service .

      - name: Security scan with Trivy
        run: trivy image my-service

      - name: Push Docker image to ECR
        run: |
          docker tag my-service:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest
          docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest

      - name: Deploy to ECS
        run: ./deploy.sh

```

## üîê DevSecOps Best Practices

**DevSecOps** integrates security practices directly into the DevOps pipeline. Below are key practices that ensure security at every stage of development and deployment.

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Practices

#### 1. üîç Automated Security Testing

Integrate security scanning tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **SonarQube**, or **Trivy** into the CI/CD pipeline to perform both static and dynamic security analysis on the code and Docker container images. These tools help identify vulnerabilities before they reach production, ensuring a more secure deployment process.

- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source security testing tool that helps detect vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **SonarQube**: A tool that checks the quality of code, including security flaws.
- **Trivy**: A security scanner for Docker images that helps identify vulnerabilities in the container layer.

#### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Use **Terraform** to define and manage AWS infrastructure, including networking, security configurations, and services. This ensures that the infrastructure is versioned, auditable, and repeatable, while maintaining consistent security configurations across all environments.

- **Terraform** allows you to version your infrastructure, making it easy to replicate environments and apply security controls like IAM roles, VPC settings, and security groups.

#### 3. üîë Secret Management

Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **HashiCorp Vault** to securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and certificates. Secrets should never be exposed in source code, and **AWS Secrets Manager** can rotate credentials automatically and restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Stores and manages sensitive credentials and automatically rotates them.

#### 4. ‚úÖ Code Review and Approval Gates

Implement mandatory code reviews and approval gates in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that security considerations are addressed before code is merged and deployed. This process involves automated security checks as well as manual code reviews to ensure that the code adheres to security best practices.

- **Approval gates** in the CI/CD pipeline prevent unapproved or vulnerable code from being deployed to production.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment

For deploying the application on AWS, follow these steps:

1. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:

   - Use **ELB** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple ECS containers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is recommended for HTTP/HTTPS traffic to dynamically route requests based on path or hostname.

2. **Amazon RDS**:

   - Use **RDS** to manage the relational database, ensuring automated backups, scaling, and high availability.

   - RDS supports multiple engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others, providing easy scaling and backup management.

3. **CloudWatch**:

   - Set up **CloudWatch** to monitor and log the metrics from both the application and the infrastructure.

   - Use **CloudWatch Alarms** to alert on high CPU usage, low disk space, or other critical metrics, and automatically trigger scaling or notifications when thresholds are reached.

### üìù Example CloudFormation for AWS Deployment

This CloudFormation template creates an **RDS** instance for database management:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyRDSInstance:
    Type: 'AWS::RDS::DBInstance'
    Properties:
      DBInstanceIdentifier: mydb-instance
      DBInstanceClass: db.t2.micro
      Engine: mysql
      MasterUsername: admin
      MasterUserPassword: your-password
      AllocatedStorage: 20

```

**DBInstanceClass**: Defines the instance size (db.t2.micro).

**Engine**: Specifies the database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL).

**MasterUsername and MasterUserPassword**: Define the master user credentials for accessing the database.

**AllocatedStorage**: Specifies the storage size in GB.

---

## üîé Security Audits

Security audits are continuously conducted to ensure the security of the system at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline. Using tools like **Aqua Security** or **Anchore**, you can analyze Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment. These tools check for security risks in your containerized applications, ensuring that only secure images are deployed to your production environment.

### Tools for Security Audits

- **Aqua Security**: Provides container security, including scanning for vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security policies.

- **Anchore**: A tool that performs deep analysis of container images, identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security standards.

Integrating these security audits in your CI/CD pipeline helps ensure that every image and every version deployed to **AWS ECS** is secure.

---

## üìä CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring

Effective monitoring of the CI/CD pipeline ensures that potential issues are detected early. By integrating **AWS CloudWatch** and **GitHub Actions plugins**, you can track the health of your deployments, monitor pipeline execution, and create alerts for failed jobs or anomalies.

### Key Monitoring Practices

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Used to track system metrics and monitor the status of deployed applications.

- **GitHub Actions Plugins**: Use plugins in GitHub Actions to log important events, track job execution, and report statuses to external monitoring tools like CloudWatch.

With CloudWatch, you can set up alarms to notify the team in case of failed builds, deployments, or any abnormal behavior during the pipeline execution.

---

## üìà Example: GitHub Actions Pipeline with Monitoring Integration

Here is an example of a **GitHub Actions** pipeline that deploys the backend application to **AWS** and reports deployment status to **AWS CloudWatch**.

```yaml
name: Backend CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Docker image for service
        run: docker build -t my-service .

      - name: Push Docker image to ECR
        run: |
          docker tag my-service:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest
          docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest

      - name: Deploy to ECS
        run: ./deploy.sh

      - name: Report deployment status to CloudWatch
        run: |
          aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
            --metric-name DeploymentStatus \
            --value 1 \
            --namespace CI/CD \
            --region us-east-1

```

- **The Deploy to ECS step** deploys the service to Amazon ECS.

- **The Report deployment status to CloudWatch step** sends a custom metric (DeploymentStatus) to CloudWatch, allowing you to monitor the status of your deployment.

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: This can be further enhanced by creating custom dashboards in CloudWatch to visualize the pipeline's health and deployment status.

---

## üìú Logging

Ensure that all logs from **GitHub Actions**, **AWS**, and the **microservices** are collected in **CloudWatch** or **Elasticsearch** for centralized logging and security analysis.

- **GitHub Actions**: The pipeline logs should be captured in GitHub for each build and deployment process. Logs can be integrated with **CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring and alerting.

- **AWS Services**:
  All logs generated by AWS services such as **ECS**, **RDS**, and **CloudWatch** metrics should be stored centrally in **CloudWatch Logs**. This enables the team to track application performance, debug issues, and ensure the system's health is continuously monitored.

- **Microservices Logs**:
  Each microservice should be configured to send logs to **CloudWatch** or **Elasticsearch** for centralized storage. This can be done through the **AWS SDK** or by configuring **Docker** containers to log to **AWS CloudWatch** directly.

Example configuration for logging to CloudWatch in an ECS task definition:

```json
"logConfiguration": {
  "logDriver": "awslogs",
  "options": {
    "awslogs-group": "/ecs/service-name",
    "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
    "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
  }
}

```

---

## üê≥ Docker Versioning

To ensure traceability and version management in your CI/CD pipeline, Docker images should be tagged with version numbers that correspond to specific **Git commits** or **release versions**.

### Versioning Strategy

Each Docker image should be tagged with the corresponding **Git commit hash** or **semantic versioning**. This allows you to track which version of the application was deployed and facilitates rollback if needed.

### Example Tagging Scheme

- `my-service:latest` for the most recent stable version.

- `my-service:v1.0.0` for the first release version.

- `my-service:commit-<git_commit_hash>` for specific builds.

### Example GitHub Actions step for Docker versioning:

```yaml
- name: Build Docker image
  run: |
    COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
    docker build -t my-service:${COMMIT_HASH} .
    docker tag my-service:${COMMIT_HASH} <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:${COMMIT_HASH}
    docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:${COMMIT_HASH}

```

- This ensures that each Docker image is traceable and corresponds to a specific code version, and that it is pushed to your Amazon ECR repository with the appropriate tag.

---

## üéØ General Objectives and Benefits

This architecture aims to ensure the following objectives:

### **Scalability**

Use **AWS services** such as **EC2**, **ECS**, **RDS**, and **Auto Scaling** to handle growth efficiently. The system is designed to scale horizontally by adding more containers or resources as traffic and usage increase, ensuring that the application can accommodate increasing demand without performance degradation.

- **EC2 Auto Scaling** dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on load.
- **ECS** and **RDS** automatically scale to handle more traffic as needed.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** distributes incoming traffic to ensure optimal resource usage.

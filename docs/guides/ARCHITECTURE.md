## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and AWS Integration

### Frontend

The deployment automates:

1. Building the Vue.js SPA.

2. Uploading the `dist/` folder to **S3**.

3. Invalidating CloudFront cache to reflect updates.

  ```yaml
  name: Frontend CI/CD Pipeline

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    build_and_deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Install Dependencies
          run: npm install

        - name: Build Vue.js Application
          run: npm run build

        - name: Deploy to S3
          run: |
            aws s3 sync dist/ s3://<S3_BUCKET_NAME> --delete
            aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <DISTRIBUTION_ID> --paths "/*"

  ```

### Backend

The deployment automates:

1. Building Docker images for microservices.

2. Pushing images to Amazon ECR.

3. Deploying to Amazon ECS.

  ```yaml
  name: Backend CI/CD Pipeline

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    build_and_deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Build Docker image
          run: docker build -t my-service .

        - name: Push Docker image to ECR
          run: |
            docker tag my-service:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest
            docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest

        - name: Deploy to ECS
          run: ./deploy.sh

  ```

## 🔐 DevSecOps Best Practices

Security is integrated at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure secure deployments.

### 🛡️ Keys

#### 1. 🔍 Automated Security Testing

Integrate security scanning tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **SonarQube**, or **Trivy** into the CI/CD pipeline to perform both static and dynamic security analysis on the code and Docker container images. These tools help identify vulnerabilities before they reach production, ensuring a more secure deployment process.

- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source security testing tool that helps detect vulnerabilities in web applications.

- **SonarQube**: A tool that checks the quality of code, including security flaws.

- **Trivy**: A security scanner for Docker images that helps identify vulnerabilities in the container layer.

#### 2. 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Terraform** allows you to version your infrastructure, making it easy to replicate environments and apply security controls like IAM roles, VPC settings, and security groups.

#### 3. 🔑 Secret Management

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Stores and manages sensitive credentials and automatically rotates them.

#### 4. ✅ Code Review and Approval Gates

- **Approval gates** in the CI/CD pipeline prevent unapproved or vulnerable code from being deployed to production.

## ☁️ AWS Deployment

### Frontend Infra

**S3**:

- Configured for static website hosting.

- index.html serves as the entry point.

**CloudFront**:

- Distributes static assets globally.

- Cache invalidation ensures updated content delivery.

### Backend Infra

**ECS**:

- Orchestrates Dockerized microservices.

**ECR**:

- Stores Docker images securely.

**RDS**:

- Scalable database with automated backups.

---

## 🔎 Security Audits

- **Aqua Security**: Provides container security, including scanning for vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security policies.

- **Anchore**: A tool that performs deep analysis of container images, identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security standards.

Integrating these security audits in your CI/CD pipeline helps ensure that every image and every version deployed to **AWS ECS** is secure.

---

## 📊 Monitoring

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Used to track system metrics and monitor the status of deployed applications.

- **GitHub Actions Plugins**: Use plugins in GitHub Actions to log important events, track job execution, and report statuses to external monitoring tools like CloudWatch.

---

## 📈 Example: GitHub Actions Pipeline with Monitoring Integration

Here is an example of a **GitHub Actions** pipeline that deploys the backend application to **AWS** and reports deployment status to **AWS CloudWatch**.

  ```yaml
  name: Backend CI/CD Pipeline with Monitoring

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    build_and_deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Build Docker image for service
          run: docker build -t my-service .

        - name: Push Docker image to ECR
          run: |
            docker tag my-service:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest
            docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-service:latest

        - name: Deploy to ECS
          run: ./deploy.sh

        - name: Report deployment status to CloudWatch
          run: |
            aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
              --metric-name DeploymentStatus \
              --value 1 \
              --namespace CI/CD \
              --region us-east-1

  ```

- **The Deploy to ECS step** deploys the service to Amazon ECS.

- **The Report deployment status to CloudWatch step** sends a custom metric (DeploymentStatus) to CloudWatch, allowing you to monitor the status of your deployment.

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: This can be further enhanced by creating custom dashboards in CloudWatch to visualize the pipeline's health and deployment status.

---

## 📜 Logging

Ensure that all logs from **GitHub Actions**, **AWS**, and the **microservices** are collected in **CloudWatch** or **Elasticsearch** for centralized logging and security analysis.

- **GitHub Actions**: The pipeline logs should be captured in GitHub for each build and deployment process. Logs can be integrated with **CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring and alerting.

- **AWS Services**:
  All logs generated by AWS services such as **ECS**, **RDS**, and **CloudWatch** metrics should be stored centrally in **CloudWatch Logs**. This enables the team to track application performance, debug issues, and ensure the system's health is continuously monitored.

- **Microservices Logs**:
  Each microservice should be configured to send logs to **CloudWatch** or **Elasticsearch** for centralized storage. This can be done through the **AWS SDK** or by configuring **Docker** containers to log to **AWS CloudWatch** directly.

Example configuration for logging to CloudWatch in an ECS task definition:

  ```json
  "logConfiguration": {
    "logDriver": "awslogs",
    "options": {
      "awslogs-group": "/ecs/service-name",
      "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
      "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
    }
  }

  ```

---

## 🐳 Docker Versioning

### Strategy

Each Docker image should be tagged with the corresponding **Git commit hash** or **semantic versioning**. This allows you to track which version of the application was deployed and facilitates rollback if needed.

- `my-service:latest` for the most recent stable version.

- `my-service:v1.0.0` for the first release version.

- `my-service:commit-<git_commit_hash>` for specific builds.

---

## 🎯 Objectives and Benefits

### **Scalability**

- **S3** + **CloudFront** ensures the frontend can handle high traffic efficiently.

- **ECS** + **RDS** scale backend services dynamically.

### **Security**

- **Automated security testing** using tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Trivy** in the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Code review gates** in GitHub Actions to enforce security checks before deployment.

- **Secret management** using **AWS Secrets Manager** to securely handle sensitive data and credentials.

### **Automation**

- **GitHub Actions** automates the build, test, and deployment of both frontend and backend services.

- **Docker** is used to containerize the services, making deployments consistent and portable.

- **AWS ECS** orchestrates containers, ensuring automatic scaling and high availability.

### **Cost Efficiency**

- **EC2 Auto Scaling** adjusts the number of instances according to demand, reducing unnecessary costs during low traffic.

- **AWS RDS** offers cost-effective database management with automatic backups and scaling.

- **ECS**, **S3**, and **CloudFront** help reduce infrastructure costs by efficiently managing containerized applications and static assets.
